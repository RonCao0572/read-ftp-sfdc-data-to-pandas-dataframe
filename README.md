# read-ftp-sfdc-data-to-pandas-dataframe

Useful codes to read data from FTP site / Salesforce reportes

Spent a few hours on figuring out how to read the data from these two places without writing them into a certain place and reading them again

Might be useful for some people who are working on FTP site and Salesforce data manipulation in Python
